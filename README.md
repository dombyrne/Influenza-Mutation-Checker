# Influenza-Mutation-Checker
A software tool designed to check influenza protein sequences for a user-defined set of mutations. This was originally designed to check for the changes found in the CDC H5N1 Genetic Changes Inventory (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pdf/avianflu/h5n1-inventory.pdf), however this tool can be used to check for:

  - Residue substitutions
  - Single- or multi- residue deletions
  - Sequence motifs
